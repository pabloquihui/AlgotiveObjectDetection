# Object Detection Production Challenge
This project has the scripts for object detection using YOLOv8 and its optimization using ONNX Runtime. 

## Usage
The file video_processor_onnx.py contains the class and functions neccessary to run the model after loading the videos in a local path and install the requirements.txt dependencies.

## Comparison of models
The comparison between the best model was done using a jupyter notebook named comparison_yolo.ipynb
